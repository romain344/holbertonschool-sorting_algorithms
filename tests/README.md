# Sorting Algorithms

## Description

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum. It focuses on implementing various sorting algorithms in the C programming language, following strict requirements including the Betty coding style and limited use of standard library functions.

Each algorithm must sort either an array of integers or a doubly linked list, depending on the task, and must follow specific formatting and performance requirements.

---

## Compilation

All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with the following flags:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89
```

---

## Project Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `print_array.c` | Prints an array of integers |
| `print_list.c` | Prints a doubly linked list |
| `sort.h` | Header file containing all prototypes and type definitions |
| `2-selection_sort.c` | Implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm |
| `2-O` | Time complexity of the Selection Sort algorithm |

---

## Implemented Algorithms

- Selection Sort

---

## Example Usage

Example using the Selection Sort algorithm:

```c
int array[] = {19, 48, 99, 71, 13, 52, 96, 73, 86, 7};
size_t n = sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]);

print_array(array, n);
selection_sort(array, n);
print_array(array, n);
```

---

## Requirements

- No use of global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- Only allowed standard functions: `malloc`, `free`, `exit` (unless specified otherwise)
- All header files must be include-guarded
- Each file must end with a new line
